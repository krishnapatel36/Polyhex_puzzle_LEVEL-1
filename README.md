*Working of the Code*
involves several Python scripts to solve polyhex puzzles, focusing on hexagonal pieces. Here's how the main components work:

*dlx.py*
Implements the Dancing Links (DLX) algorithm, which is a technique for solving exact cover problems efficiently. This is crucial for arranging puzzle pieces without overlap.

*hexa_rotation_flip.py*
Manages the rotation and flipping of hexagonal pieces to fit them into the puzzle grid correctly. This ensures that all possible orientations of a piece are considered during the solution process.

*new_hexa.py*
Contains additional functionalities for manipulating and working with hexagonal puzzle pieces, possibly including custom logic for specific puzzle types.

*polymino.py*
Handles polyomino pieces, which are shapes made up of connected squares, extended to work with hexagonal shapes (polyhexes). This includes defining their properties and fitting them into the puzzle.

*Workflow*
Input: The puzzle configuration and pieces are provided as input.
Processing:
DLX Algorithm: Used to find an exact cover solution, ensuring pieces fit without overlap.
Rotation and Flipping: hexa_rotation_flip.py ensures each piece is tested in all possible orientations.
Additional Logic: new_hexa.py and polymino.py manage the properties and placement of pieces.
Output: The solution to the puzzle, showing the arrangement of hexagonal pieces that fit perfectly into the given grid.
This modular approach allows for efficient and flexible solving of complex polyhex puzzles.
