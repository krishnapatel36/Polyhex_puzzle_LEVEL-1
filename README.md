What Happens During Execution
Input Handling: The scripts take input in the form of puzzle configurations and hexagonal pieces.
Data Processing:
DLX Algorithm (dlx.py): Implements the Dancing Links algorithm to find an exact cover solution.
Rotation and Flipping (hexa_rotation_flip.py): Handles all possible orientations of the hexagonal pieces to fit them into the grid.
Hexagonal Puzzle Logic (new_hexa.py and polymino.py): Additional functionalities for defining and managing polyhex shapes and their placement.
Expected Output
Solution to Puzzle: The output will be a solution to the polyhex puzzle, showing the arrangement of hexagonal pieces that fit perfectly into the given grid without overlaps.
Visualization: Depending on the script, you might get a visual representation of the puzzle solution or logs detailing the steps taken to solve the puzzle.
